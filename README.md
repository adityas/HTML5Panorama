HTML5 Panorama Viewer
=============

Recently, while working with panoramic images for my research, I decided to implement a panorama viewer purely in HTML5. Most panorama viewers online require plugins like Flash or Java, but since HTML5 has a shiny new canvas element, I thought it would be a worthwhile experiment.

The viewer assumes a cylindrical projection. Essentially, by slicing up the original image, we can independently stretch out each slice to give the image surface the appearance of a 3D cylinder. The math to re-project a rectangular panorama onto a cylinder is fairly simple (involves cosecants, more details in code).

With num_slices = 20. Individual slices are visible.


If the number of slices is fairly high, it’s hard to make out that there’s any slicing at all.

With num_slices = 600


Of course, the more slices there are, the better the panorama will look, but consequently, the poorer it will perform.
Here’s a couple of demos I threw together. Click (or touch) and drag to pan:

Basic Usage
=============

    HTML5Panorama({
        canvas  : "my_canvas_id", // id of canvas element or DOM Element
        src     : "http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~aditya/files/photos/pano/mountains.jpeg", // source of image
        num_slices : 500 // not mandatory. default "auto"
    });

Advanced Usage
=============

    HTML5Panorama({
        canvas                       : document.getElementById("my_canvas_id"), // DOM Canvas Element
        src                          : "http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~aditya/files/photos/pano/mountains.jpeg",
        initialSpeed                 : 10, // move the image on load
        num_slices                   : ('ontouchstart' in window)? 180 : 600,
        silentDegradeQualityIfNeeded : true
    });
 
 
If you’re interested, feel free to delve into the source code and reuse/hack it as you see fit. Hopefully in the near future, I’ll add support for zoom, vertical panning, spherical projections and improve the overall performance.

PS: Requires an HTML5 compatible browser (Chrome/Safari/Firefox/Opera). Works on the iPhone/iPad too.
